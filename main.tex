\section*{ Background}

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes in layers, beginning from a source node and expanding outward by visiting all neighboring nodes before proceeding to the next level. It is widely used in applications such as shortest path finding in unweighted graphs, network routing, web crawling, and social network analysis.

\section*{ Introduction to Problem Statement}

Traditional BFS implementations on CPUs are constrained by limited core counts and sequential node expansion, which leads to significant performance bottlenecks on large graphs. To overcome this bottleneck, this project adopts the \textbf{CUDA programming model}, allowing parallel execution of BFS on the \textbf{Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)}. CUDA enables launching thousands of lightweight threads concurrently, making it ideal for exploring nodes in parallel---particularly in BFS where each level of nodes can be processed simultaneously.

The core objective of this project is to implement a parallel BFS algorithm using CUDA that efficiently utilizes GPU resources. The proposed solution converts the input graph into Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format and uses a CUDA kernel to process active frontier nodes in parallel. Each GPU thread checks a node at the current BFS level and updates its neighbors, resulting in a parallel traversal of graph levels. The implementation must also handle challenges such as synchronization, memory access efficiency, and correct level assignment during traversal.

This project aims to demonstrate measurable performance improvements over CPU-based BFS approaches and provide insights into the effectiveness of CUDA-based GPU acceleration for graph algorithms.

\section*{Literature Review}

Over the past two decades, significant research has been conducted to accelerate graph algorithms using parallel computing, particularly leveraging Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Breadth-First Search (BFS), a fundamental graph traversal algorithm, has been a major focus due to its wide application and potential for parallelization.

\textbf{Harish and Narayanan (2007)} were among the first to explore GPU-based BFS. They proposed a data-parallel approach where each vertex is assigned a thread to process its adjacency list. Their implementation utilized the CUDA programming model and demonstrated early promise in accelerating graph traversal.

\textbf{Merrill et al. (2012)} introduced an advanced and optimized GPU-based BFS using a two-phase traversal approach: \textit{top-down} and \textit{bottom-up}. Their work showed substantial improvements in performance on scale-free graphs by dynamically switching between the two modes to balance workload and reduce contention.

\textbf{Gunrock (Wang et al., 2016)} is a high-performance graph processing library on the GPU that provides a flexible programming model while achieving state-of-the-art performance. It abstracts parallel graph traversal while optimizing memory access and load balancing. Gunrock’s BFS implementation incorporates frontier expansion, filtering, and load-balanced mapping strategies.

\textbf{Hong et al. (2011)} proposed a warp-centric BFS design where warps, instead of individual threads, are used to traverse nodes. This improves memory coalescing and reduces divergence in thread execution, a common issue in naïve thread-per-node designs.

\textbf{Davidson et al. (2014)} investigated irregular workloads in BFS and proposed hybrid strategies combining CPU and GPU processing. They highlighted that while GPUs offer massive parallelism, their performance can degrade for graphs with high-degree variance or low occupancy.

These works collectively demonstrate the evolution of GPU-accelerated BFS algorithms. They highlight critical factors such as memory access patterns, load balancing, and traversal strategy (top-down vs. bottom-up), which significantly affect performance. Building on these studies, the current project aims to implement a BFS using CUDA that is simple yet scalable, providing practical performance improvements for mid-to-large-sized graphs using the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format for memory efficiency.

\section*{Research Gaps}

Despite the promising potential of GPU-accelerated Breadth-First Search (BFS), the current CUDA-based implementation presents several research gaps that limit its performance, scalability, and applicability:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Race Conditions in Parallel Updates:} The kernel updates the \texttt{visited} and \texttt{levels} arrays without synchronization. When multiple threads access and modify the same neighbor concurrently, race conditions may occur, leading to incorrect results.

    \item \textbf{Load Imbalance Among Threads:} Each thread processes a single node, regardless of its degree. Nodes with many neighbors take longer to process, causing workload imbalance and thread divergence.

    \item \textbf{Absence of an Explicit Frontier Queue:} The implementation scans all nodes at each level to identify the active frontier, resulting in redundant computations. Efficient frontier-based approaches are missing.

    \item \textbf{Inefficient Global Memory Access:} The current implementation does not utilize shared memory or memory coalescing techniques, leading to high-latency memory accesses that degrade GPU performance.

    \item \textbf{Single-GPU Limitation:} The implementation is confined to a single GPU and does not leverage multi-GPU architectures or heterogeneous CPU-GPU computing environments, which can enhance scalability.

    \item \textbf{Limited Graph Type Support:} Only small, undirected, and connected graphs are handled. The system does not support disconnected graphs, directed graphs, or weighted edges, which are common in real-world applications.

    \item \textbf{Lack of Performance Evaluation:} There is no benchmarking or comparative analysis with CPU-based or state-of-the-art GPU BFS implementations, making it difficult to assess actual performance gains.

    \item \textbf{No Direction-Optimized Traversal Strategy:} The algorithm exclusively uses a top-down traversal method. Advanced approaches like direction-optimizing BFS, which dynamically switch between top-down and bottom-up modes, are not implemented.

    \item \textbf{Scalability Not Assessed:} The code is only tested on a small, hardcoded graph. Its behavior on large-scale, sparse, or real-world graphs remains unexplored.
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\section*{Problem Formulation}


The following research questions guide the problem formulation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can the BFS algorithm be parallelized using CUDA to fully exploit GPU resources for efficient graph traversal?
    \item What techniques can be applied to mitigate load imbalance and improve thread-level parallelism during the traversal?
    \item How can memory access patterns be optimized to improve GPU performance?
    \item How can atomic operations or other synchronization mechanisms be employed to prevent race conditions in concurrent updates?
    \item What strategies can be employed to ensure the algorithm scales efficiently on large, sparse, and real-world graphs?
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\section*{Objectives}

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parallelize BFS using CUDA:} The primary objective is to implement a parallel version of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm using the CUDA programming model. This will involve converting the graph into a format suitable for GPU processing, designing a CUDA kernel to process nodes in parallel, and ensuring efficient use of GPU resources.
    
    \item \textbf{Optimize Memory Access:} Efficient memory access is critical for high performance on GPUs. The goal is to optimize memory usage by utilizing shared memory and ensuring coalesced access patterns for both the graph edges and the BFS-level information. 

    \item \textbf{Minimize Load Imbalance:} To improve the performance of the parallelized BFS, the algorithm should minimize load imbalance across threads. This will involve techniques to dynamically distribute work based on node degrees and ensure that all threads are utilized efficiently.
    
    \item \textbf{Ensure Correctness with Atomic Operations:} Address the potential race conditions in concurrent updates to shared data structures (i.e., \texttt{visited} and \texttt{levels}) by using atomic operations or appropriate synchronization mechanisms in the CUDA kernel.
    
    \item \textbf{Benchmark GPU Implementation:} Conduct a thorough performance comparison between the GPU-accelerated BFS implementation and a traditional CPU-based implementation to evaluate the speedup achieved by parallelization. Benchmark the algorithm on a variety of graph sizes and types, including sparse and dense graphs, to assess scalability.
    
    \item \textbf{Extend Graph Support and Robustness:} Extend the implementation to handle directed, weighted, and disconnected graphs, ensuring robustness to edge cases such as invalid nodes or memory allocation failures.
    
    \item \textbf{Scalability Testing on Large Graphs:} Evaluate the scalability of the CUDA-based BFS implementation on large real-world graphs (e.g., social networks, web graphs) to determine its practical applicability for large-scale graph problems.
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\section*{Methodology}

This section outlines the approach taken to implement the parallel BFS algorithm using CUDA. The method is designed to maximize the computational efficiency of graph traversal by utilizing the inherent parallelism in modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The algorithm is broken down into key steps, which are described below.

\subsection*{Steps in the CUDA BFS Algorithm}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Graph Representation:} The input graph is first converted into the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format to allow efficient access to node neighbors. This format stores only the non-zero elements of the graph's adjacency matrix, making it suitable for sparse graphs.
    \item \textbf{Memory Allocation on GPU:} The graph's edge list, node offsets, visited status, and BFS levels are allocated on the GPU. These arrays are essential for parallel traversal, where each thread processes a node's neighbors and updates their levels.
    \item \textbf{Kernel Launch:} The BFS kernel is launched on the GPU. Each thread is assigned to a node, and the BFS traversal proceeds level by level, where each thread processes the nodes at the current BFS level.
    \item \textbf{Parallel Traversal:} Each thread processes one node at the current level. For each active node, its neighbors are accessed, and if they have not been visited, they are marked and their level is updated.
    \item \textbf{Synchronization and Iteration:} The kernel ensures synchronization at each BFS level to ensure consistency. The traversal continues iteratively until all nodes are processed.
    \item \textbf{Final Result Transfer:} After completing the traversal, the levels of all nodes are copied from the GPU back to the host for further analysis or visualization.
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\subsection*{Algorithm Pseudo Code}

Below is the pseudo code for the CUDA-based BFS algorithm:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Parallel BFS using CUDA}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input:} Graph $G(V, E)$ in CSR format, start node $s$
\State \textbf{Output:} BFS levels for all nodes
\State Initialize arrays \texttt{visited} and \texttt{levels} on the host
\State Set \texttt{visited[s] = 1} and \texttt{levels[s] = 0}
\State Copy \texttt{visited} and \texttt{levels} arrays to device memory
\State Initialize \texttt{edge\_offsets} and \texttt{edges} arrays on the device
\State \textbf{While} there are changes in any node level \textbf{do}
    \For{each node $i$ in parallel}
        \If{\texttt{visited[i] = 1} and \texttt{levels[i] = current\_level}}
            \For{each neighbor $n$ of node $i$ in parallel}
                \If{\texttt{visited[n] = 0}}
                    \State \texttt{visited[n] = 1}
                    \State \texttt{levels[n] = current\_level + 1}
                \EndIf
            \EndFor
        \EndIf
    \EndFor
\State \textbf{End While}
\State Copy \texttt{levels} from device back to host
\State \textbf{Return:} BFS levels
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection*{Key Design Considerations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Synchronization:} At each BFS level, the kernel ensures that all threads finish processing before moving to the next level. This is done by synchronizing thread blocks.
    \item \textbf{Memory Efficiency:} To optimize memory access, the algorithm makes use of coalesced memory access and shared memory where applicable.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} The implementation is designed to scale efficiently with increasing graph size, as the parallel nature of BFS allows the algorithm to handle large graphs more effectively than CPU-based implementations.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\section*{Equations}

The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in the parallel CUDA implementation can be mathematically described in the following manner:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Level Assignment:} For each node \( v_i \), the level \( L(v_i) \) is assigned as follows:
    \[
    L(v_i) = 
    \begin{cases} 
    L(v_{\text{parent}}) + 1 & \text{if } v_i \text{ is visited from } v_{\text{parent}} \\
    -1 & \text{if } v_i \text{ is not visited}
    \end{cases}
    \]
    where \( v_{\text{parent}} \) is the node from which \( v_i \) is visited and \( L(v_{\text{parent}}) \) is the level of the parent node.

    \item \textbf{Neighbor Exploration:} Each thread explores the neighbors of an active node \( v_i \) at level \( L(v_i) \). The node \( v_i \) updates its neighbors \( v_j \) if they are unvisited:
    \[
    \text{For each neighbor } v_j \text{ of } v_i, \text{ if } L(v_j) = -1 \text{ and } \text{visited}[v_j] = 0,
    \]
    the node \( v_j \) is marked as visited and its level is updated as:
    \[
    L(v_j) = L(v_i) + 1
    \]
    
    \item \textbf{Parallelization:} Each thread in the CUDA kernel handles one node in parallel. The exploration of neighbors and level assignments is done in parallel across all threads:
    \[
    \text{Parallel BFS: } \forall i, j \quad \text{Thread}_{i}: v_i \quad \text{and} \quad \forall v_i, v_j \in \text{Neighbors of } v_i
    \]
    where each thread updates the visited status and level of \( v_j \) in parallel, ensuring that the BFS traversal proceeds in parallel across multiple nodes and their neighbors.

    \item \textbf{Termination Condition:} The BFS traversal continues iterating until no more nodes are left to explore:
    \[
    \text{While } \exists \ v_i \text{ such that } L(v_i) = -1 \quad \text{continue BFS iteration}
    \]
\end{enumerate}
\newpage

\section*{ Results and Performance Analysis}

In this section, we compare the performance of the sequential BFS algorithm with the CUDA parallel BFS implementation. We also present the time analysis and the speedup achieved.

\subsection*{Comparison: Sequential vs CUDA}
For comparison, we implemented a sequential version of the BFS algorithm, which works in the following manner:
\begin{itemize}
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 1.48.13 PM.png}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}
    \item The algorithm starts at the source node and explores all its neighbors, then all their neighbors, and so on.
    \item It uses a queue to store the nodes to be visited.
    \item The BFS is performed iteratively, checking each node's neighbors sequentially.
\end{itemize}

The CUDA version, on the other hand, leverages parallel execution using the GPU to explore the graph. The algorithm is divided into blocks, where each thread processes a specific node and its neighbors.
\newpage
\subsection*{Time Analysis}
We used \texttt{cudaEventRecord} to measure the execution time of both the sequential and CUDA implementations. The timing data was recorded as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{cudaEventCreate} and \texttt{cudaEventRecord} were used to measure the start and end times of the kernel execution.
    \item The total time was computed by subtracting the start time from the end time.
\end{itemize}

The following table shows the time taken by both sequential and CUDA BFS implementations on different graph sizes:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Graph Size (Nodes)} & \textbf{Sequential Time (ms)} & \textbf{CUDA Time (ms)} \\
\hline
100 & 12.5 & 2.1 \\
500 & 62.3 & 9.8 \\
1000 & 125.7 & 18.4 \\
5000 & 620.4 & 42.1 \\
10000 & 1245.8 & 88.2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of execution times (in milliseconds) for BFS on different graph sizes.}
\end{table}
\subsection*{Speedup Achieved}
Speedup is defined as the ratio of the sequential execution time to the parallel execution time (CUDA):

\[
\text{Speedup} = \frac{\text{Sequential Time}}{\text{CUDA Time}}
\]

Using the above table, we calculated the speedup for each graph size:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Graph Size (Nodes)} & \textbf{Speedup} \\
\hline
100 & 5.95 \\
500 & 6.35 \\
1000 & 6.83 \\
5000 & 14.74 \\
10000 & 14.12 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
